     AND A FINE SUPPORTING CAST, INCLUDING:

	JANE KIENENGER,JIM MCCRAE,TYE SHULTZ,CLEMENT WONG,
	MUKESH SUNDARAM,AND MANY OTHERS.

	1. OVERVIEW

	FELIX IS A SIMPLE ANIMATION SYSTEM WHICH USES
	THE CROMEMCO TV DAZZLER AND D+7A ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL
	CONVERTER WITH TWO JOYSTICKS, TO PRODUCE AND 
	EXECUTE SIMPLE STICK FIGURE ANIMATIONS. THE 
	END GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE THESE:

		A: TO PROVIDE CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL STUDY PROJECTS
		   FOR ENTERTAINMENT,EDIFICATION AND EDUCATION
		   IN MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE AND GRAPHICS
		  ISSUES OF ALL SORTS.

		B: TO BUILD A BASIS UPON WHICH CAN BE ERECTED A
		   SUPERSTRUCTURE OF SOFTWARE FOR USE IN ELEMENTARY
		   AND SECONDARY COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION.

	  	C: TO PROVIDE A 'COMMON GROUND' FOR HOBBYESTS AND 
		   ACADEMICS (AND ANYONE ELSE) WANTING TO EXCHANGE
		   IDEAS IN ANIMATION.

	FELIX IS FULLY DEFINED AN DOCUMENTED IN THREE TECHNICAL REPORTS
		(FELIX REPORTS 1,2,3,OBVIOUSLY) WHICH ARE AVAILABLE
		FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE
			 COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT
			 (ATTENTION: MICROCOMPUTER CLUB)
			 KNOXVILLE, TN 37916
		FOR $10.00. THE SOFTWARE, IN
		SOURCE CODE AND EXECUTABLE FORM, IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE
		CP/M USER'S GROUP OR FROM THE ABOVE ADDRESS.

	TWO VOLUMES OF SOFTWARE EXIST: THE BASE VOLUME, 
		CONTAINING FELIX VERSION 2.1 WITH ALL SOURCE CODE, .COM
		FILES FOR ALL THE UTILITY PROGRAMS, AND SOME EXAMPLES;

		VOLUME 2,CONTAINING SOURCE CODE FOR THE UTILITY PROGRAMS,
		AND MANY MORE CARTOON AND ARTISTIC EXAMPLE PROGRAMS.

		EACH VOLUME IS AVAILABLE FOR $10.00 FROM THE ABOVE ADDRESS.

	2. CONCEPTS OF FELIX

	FELIX IS BASED ON THE NOTION OF A 'PSEUDO-MACHINE', WHICH IS 
		ACTUALLY AN INTERPRETER PROGRAM EXECUTING A LANGUAGE
		THAT LOOKS LIKE MACHINE-CODE FOR SOME MICROPROCESSOR.
		THE SPECIAL FEATURE OF FELIX-CODE IS THAT SIMPLE ONE-
		OPCODE COMMANDS CAN CAUSE COMPLEX SCREEN EVENTS TO 
		OCCUR, RESULTING IN CARTOONS OR KINETIC ART BEING
		DESCRIBED BY RATHER SHORT SIMPLE PROGRAMS. 

	THE PSEUDO-MACHINE ALSO ALLOWS US TO AT LEAST DREAM OF TRANSPORTABILITY
		IN THE SENSE THAT WHEN PSEUDO-MACHINE INTERPRETERS ARE WRITTEN
		FOR OTHER HARDWARE (APPLE IS UNDERWAY) THE CARTOONS,
		AND OTHER CODE CAN BE CARRIED RIGHT ALONG WITHOUT A LOT OF 
		REWRITING.

	THE MOST EXCITING CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT HIGHER-LEVEL LANGUAGES,
		FELIX UTILITIES, ASSEMBLERS,EDITORS,ETC CAN
		BE EXPRESSED IN FELIX CODE ITSELF, AND EXECUTE RAPIDLY ON
		ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE HARDWARE YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO FAVOR
		WITH THE CREATION OF THE PSEUDO-MACHINE.

	2. DETAILS: HOW DOES IT WORK?

	IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL YOU MUCH WITHOUT A FIFTY PAGE TECH REPORT,
		WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IN DISK-STORABLE FORM.
		(IT HAS PICTURES IN IT,FOR INSTANCE). IN BROAD OUTLINE  WE
		HAVE AN ASSEMBLER (FASM) WHICH TAKES PSEUDO-MACHINE ASSEMBLER
		LANGUAGE (.FAS FILES) AND PRODUCES EXECUTABLE FELIX FILES
		(.FEX). THEN THE 'DOODLER' PROGRAM IS USED TO CREATE SCREEN
		OBJECTS AND BACKGROUNDS TO GO WITH THE FILES, (OBJECTS AND 
		SCENES CAN ALSO BE STORED USING 'LOADOB,STOREOB',ETC)
		AND THE ENTIRE MESS SAVED OR EXECUTED. THE FOLLOWING SHOULD 
		GIVE YOU ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ORDER THE
		TECH REPORTS.

	3. AN EXAMPLE

	THE PROGRAM 'PAINTER' IS A GOOD STARTING PLACE. THIS PROGRAM MOVES
		SEVERAL (PAINT-BRUSHES) ABOUT THE SCREEN; THE BRUSH TO MOVE
		IS SELECTED IN YOUR SWITCH REGISTER (HOPE YOU HAVE ONE).
		PUSHING THE BUTTONS ON THE CROMEMCO JOYSTICKS SELECTS COLORS
		IN WHICH TO PAINT. AN ADDED A/D CHANNEL (CHANNEL 1D,EASY 
		TO PATCH INTO YOUR JOYSTICK-2; SEE TECH REPORT 3 FOR HOW )
		ALLOWS CONTROL OVER THE ROTATION OF THE JOYSTICK-MOVED
		PAINTBRUSHES....IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE THIS MOD, USE THE 
		VERSION CALLED 'PAINT' RATHER THAN 'PAINTER'. 

	THE COMMANDS.

	A>FELIX

	--THIS LOADS IN FILES FELIX.OBJ AND SINCOS.OBJ IN HIGH RAM
	  (5000 AND 4000 RESPECTIVELY),FOR USE BY EVERYONE ELSE.

	A>EXEC PAINTER&

	--THIS EXECUTES A VERSION OF PAINTER WHICH INCLUDES OBJECTS 0
	THROUGH 7,PRE-DEFINED FOR YOU.SELECT WITH SWITCH-
	  REGISTER,GO TO IT. PAINT SOME STUFF.

	  TYPE CONTROL-C TO EXIT THE EXECUTION OF A PROGRAM.

	A>TYPE PAINTER.FEX

	--THIS LETS YOU LOOK AT THE PROGRAM YOU JUST RAN,JUST INCASE IT
	  MIGHT BE COMPREHENSIBLE.

	A>DOODLE

	--THIS LETS YOU DEFINE SOME NEW OBJECTS TO PAINT WITH.

	SELECT OBJECT NUMBER:1   --YOU DECIDE TO DRAW OBJECT 1.
	R	--YOU SELECT A RED COLOR TO PAINT.
	!	--YOU MAKE IT HIGH-INTENSITY
	IIIII	--YOU TYPE KEYS AROUND THE 'K' KEY TO MOVE AND DRAW
		  WITH THE MOVING CURSOR. ZERO '0' TURNS OFF THE COLOR
		  TO MOVE THE CURSOR. YOU CAN TURN IT ON AGAIN WITH ANOTHER
		  COLOR SELECTION.
	CTRL/N  --SELECTS ANOTHER OBJECT TO WORK ON.
	Z	--CLEARS SCREEN (NOT THE ACTUAL STORED OBJECTS)
	CTRL/C	--RETURNS YOU TO CP/M

	A>EXEC PAINTER	-EXECUTES A 'PAINTER' WITHOUT DEFINED OBJECTS
			 SO YOUR DOODLED ONES WILL BE MOVABLE NOW.

	4: CONVENTIONS

	FILENAMES: .FEX ARE 'EXECUTABLE' - WITH OR WITHOUT OBJECTS,ETC.
		   .FAS ARE 'FELIX SOURCE'
	           .PRN ARE LISTINGS, PRODUCED BY FASM.INCLUDES ERROR MSGS.
		   .PIC ARE OBJECTS, STORED BY SAVEOB.
		   .SCN ARE BACKGROUNDS,STORED BY SAVEBACK.
		   '&' IN A FILENAME (TYPE .FEX) MEANS THE OBJECTS ARE
			INCLUDED WITH THE FILE (SEE HOW SHORTLY)
		   '#' IN A FILENAME (TYPE .FEX) MEANS THE OBJECTS AND BACK-
			GROUND ARE INCLUDED.

	5: HOW DOES IT WORK?

	IN VERY BRIEF OUTLINE, FELIX MAINTAINS 'SDATA OBJECTS' IN A
	LINEAR LIST STORAGE SYSTEM; WHENEVER THE 'SHOW' OPERATOR IS EXECUTED
	THE OBJECTS ARE ROTATED IF NECESSARY AND PROJECTED ONTO
	THE SCREEN. FELIX IS DEFINED WITH A 255 X 255 DISPLAY SPACE AND ONLY
	A FEW ROUTINES RELY ON THE TV DAZZLER, CROMEMCO JOYSTICKS, OR ANY OTHER
	SPECIFIC HARDWARE. YOU ARE INVITED TO EXPLORE THE SOURCE CODE.

	6: EXTENSIONS  AND OTHER VERSIONS

	ONE REASON WE ARE DISTRIBUTING 'FELIX' IS THAT WE WANT FOLKS TO 
		EXPERIMENT IN ANIMATION; TO TRY OTHER IDEAS AND TO SEND THEM
		TO US! YOU ARE FREE TO DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE EXCEPT TO
		PROMULGATE ANY 'OFFICIAL' EXTENSIONS TO FELIX. TO FACILITATE
		EXPERIMENTATION WE HAVE INCLUDED FOUR OPCODES, 'USER1,...USER4'
		IN THE FASM ASSEMBLER,PRODUCING OPCODES C0,C1,C2,C3. YOU CAN
		USE THESE TO TRY NEW STUFF. YOU CAN OF COURSE GET COPIES OF 
		THE FASM ASSEMBLER FROM VOLUME II OF THIS DISTRIBUTION AND 
		PATCH THE LOOKUP TABLE TO INCLUDE YOUR OWN OPERATORS; OR 
		BUILD .FEX FILES DIRECTLY. WE DID IT FOR A YEAR...IT AIN'T
		IMPOSSIBLE.

	OUR FUTURE PLANS INCLUDE AN ADVANCED FELIX, VERSION 3, ABOUT THIS
		TIME NEXT YEAR; THIS WILL INCLUDE A HOST OF NEW OPERATORS
		AND OBJECT MAKERS,ETC, AND A HIGHER-LEVEL LANGUAGE WITH
		STRUCTURED CONTROL WHOSE COMPILER RUNS ON THE PSEUDO-MACHINE.
		WE WELCOME SUGGESTIONS AND INPUTS.
